          <p>I have dedicated my life to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against</p> 
          <p>white domination, and I have fought against black domination.</p>
          <p>I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons</p> 
          <p>will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal for which</p> 
          <p>I hope to live for and to see realized. But, My Lord, if it needs to be, it is an ideal for which</p> 
          <p>I am prepared to die.</p>
